# Domestika Creative Assistant – Prototype

## 🧪 What This Is
A simple prototype demonstrating two core user flows for Domestka’s AI-powered Creative Assistant:

1. 🎯 Plan My Learning Journey – Personalized 3-step plan based on learner’s goal.
2. 🖌️ Get Feedback on My Work – Encouraging and actionable feedback from an AI mentor.

Built using Streamlit and OpenAI GPT.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

1. Clone or open the Streamlit/Replit app.
2. Add your OpenAI API key in the secret or directly in the code.
3. Click “Run” and test both user flows.

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- Python (Streamlit)
- OpenAI GPT-4 API
- No database or real Domestika API – simulated flows only

---

## ⚠️ Known Gaps

- No image input or visual feedback yet.
- No user authentication or memory of previous sessions.
- No real-time peer matching – just placeholder logic.
- All data is mocked or generated via prompt.

## 🔬 Next Experiments

1. Integrate image upload and AI critique (e.g., CLIP, GPT Vision).
2. Add peer/community recommendations based on shared projects.
3. A/B test assistant with real Domestika learners and track creative actions.
4. Add basic personalization memory (e.g., user's current level or past courses).
